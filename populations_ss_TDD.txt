Program Description: 
This program creates a database of ten florida cities and their populations. The program then asks the user to choose a city, then it displays simulated population growth over the next 20 years in a plotted graph.

Functions used in the Program (list in order as they are called):
1. Function Name: simulate_population_growth()
     Description: This function run the calculation for population growth by using a for loop.
     Parameters: cities_population, growth_rate=0.02, years=20
     Variables: current_population: variable holding the starting population count
2. Function Name: get_population_data
     Description: This function gathers data from the database.
     Parameters: none
     Variables: none
3. Function Name: plot_population_growth
     Description: This function takes the simulated population data and plots it on a graph.
     Parameters: city
     Variables: years: holds value for how many year in simulation
		Populations: holds value for how many people in city.
4. Function Name: user_interface
     Description: This function displays a menu for the user to choose from, or press 0 to exit.
    Parameters: none
    Variables: cities: stores the city names in index.


     Logical Steps:
1.	The program displays a menu of cites for the user to choose from.
2.	The program then simulates population growth over the next 20 years.
3.	The program then plots that to a graph. 
4.	The program displays the graph for the user to see.
5.	The program then returns the menu for the user to select another choice or exit.
     Returns: Returns a display of user chosen cityâ€™s population growth over 20 years in graph form.
